  				<h1>About Me</h1>
  				<p>Hi, my name is Jordan Smithers. I am a student currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT Online. As a hobby, I like to make music! To be more specific; I like to produce, record, mix and master songs by myself and others. I can also play the drums!
              Apart from music, I like to play golf, video games and I have a real passion for motorbikes.</p>

  				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  				<p>I have always been drawn to technology ever since I was a toddler. Growing up, some of my fondest memories are playing games with my brother on the SEGA Mega Drive and RuneScape when we got computers! As I got older, like many things, I learnt more and more about technology. I had my first real spark of interest in the nitty-gritty world of IT when I was twelve or thirteen.</p>
          <p>Referring back to my RuneScape days, I had come across a YouTube video about setting up a private server. This is where I first saw the programming language called Java, I did try learning this for a while but as I was young I didn't have the dedication required. Though now I'm here some ten years later and that spark has reignited, I feel as though I can focus and really see a future in IT for me.</p>

          <h1>Why did I choose RMIT?</h1>
          <p>I chose to come to RMIT firstly because they offered the best online study which is flexible for when you work and have other commitments. Secondly, I know some people who have previously and still are studying at RMIT and they had only good things to say about the curriculum and the support provided.</p>
          <p>What I expect to learn during these studies is the foundational knowledge and building blocks to beginning a career in IT, which will in turn give me a more precise understanding of which role will suit me.</p>

          <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
          <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58322894?type=standout#sol=13c5ab717d817c695a98bcfa984ff9ed7699b5cd" target="_blank">Job Listing Here</a>
          <p>After thorough research, I've come to the conclusion that my ideal job is to be a Software Engineer. I would specifically like to work on game development, but ideally, I would be open to any project or product in that profession.</p>
          <p>You can view the Job Listing <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58322894?type=standout#sol=13c5ab717d817c695a98bcfa984ff9ed7699b5cd" target="_blank">here</a>. The position I have found is a Game Development Software Engineer role advertised by <a href="https://www.konami.com/en" target="_blank">Konami</a>. In this position, you would typically find yourself responsible for designing, developing and researching software to further aid in the development of the product. Work will be conducted in a team environment consisting of not only fellow engineers but designers and artists who will work together to provide efficient solutions and add new functionality to existing projects or products.</p>
          <p>This role appeals to me first due to my absolute interest in video games and the inner workings behind what you see on the screen as a consumer, and secondly due to my love for working as a team and seeing my fellow colleagues thrive.</p>

          <h1>Requirements for a Software Engineer</h1>
          <p>To be successful in this role, there are some specific skills, qualifications and experience that are required. In any case, you would need to be proficient in C++ and have acquired a bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Engineering or have proven relevant experience and education. Though these are examples of qualities that are imperative, I believe having knowledge in other languages (C#, Unity etc) and being aware of the Software Development Lifecycle will also prove to be extremely beneficial to this role.</p>
          <p>After reflecting on my own personal skills, qualifications and experience I have come to realise that I currently possess none of the above listed. I can attest to having good verbal and written communication, but I cannot say I have the major necessities needed for a software engineer currently. I plan to re assess my skill-set upon completion of my Bachelor of IT, then use the knowledge gained from my studies to further qualify myself either through self study or an institution. As well as this, I will try to secure an internship or an entry level position within a company.</p>

            <h1>What do these results mean for Me?</h1>
            <p>From the above results, I have learnt that I have a “Campaigner” personality, this indicates that I am outgoing, open-hearted and open-minded. Though with the positives there must be negatives, better referred to as strengths and weaknesses. Being a campaigner generally comes with traits such as; being disorganised, unfocused, overly accommodating, restless etc. In saying that, the Campaigner personality type usually boasts incredible prowess in building relationships, choosing careers and their imagination/creative ability. In light of this, the third test I decided to conduct was a creativity test; for this, I scored 87.3. This is higher than 91.81% of people who have completed that specific test, with an average score of 78. I found it interesting that this result actually backed up the Myer-Briggs test!</p>
            <p>Not only this, but I have found that I am a visual learner as well. Meaning I learn by reading, pictures, videos and demonstrations. Visual learners are often said to “close their eyes and visualise or remember something, and will find something to watch if they become bored.” This is particularly true for me.</p>

          <h1>Project Overview</h1>
          <p>To come up with a unique project is something I believe to be very hard in this day and age, though there are many defining features and functions that can make it stand out.</p>
          <p>After carefully considering and weighing my options, I've decided to go with a smartphone app created specifically for Motorbike riders. This app will provide riders with great scenic roads and facilities along the way ie. Petrol Stations, Restaurants, and Look-outs to visit based on an entered location or the GPS location of the device. Other features will include the ability to create a profile, form a group and connect with other riders, track routes and send alerts for any safety hazards/cautions on the way. Along with this, the app will provide information through voice notifications (text-to-speech).</p>
          <p>For many years now the commonality of motorcycles in Australia has been on a steady rise. Statistics show that from 2012 to 2021, the number of registered motorcycles nationwide increased from 709,288 to 913,803. By the end of 2022, evidence suggests that the number will break one million. Considering the fact that there are 20.1 million cars currently registered, this is a very minute amount. Moving forward, I strongly believe that there should be more applications tailored to motorcycle riders of all ages and experience levels.</p>

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Building on from above, this app will not only serve as a tool to increase the quality of life for motorcyclists of all experiences but also provide a safe social space for those who may be learners looking for advice and practice. Using GPS satellite technology and an interactive map, users will be able to locate and receive a route to their chosen destination; a list of suggested places nearby will also be included.</p>
        <p>As well as being able to find locations and get directions, motorcyclists will be able to track their own ride as well as their group members. In recent times, motorcycle helmets with blue-tooth headset compatibility have slowly been becoming the norm. In support of this, the app will feature voice command options and text-to-speech so you don’t need to keep glancing down at your phone. Safety is another very important feature, so an alert system will be implemented; this can either be done in the app or from a voice command. This will show up as a “caution” sign on your map.</p>
        <p>To take this concept one step further, the addition of a “track” mode will be built in. This side of the app will allow the user to input a track they are currently riding at and record their lap times. You will have the option to either publish your time or keep it private (other app users' times will be recorded and displayed).</p>

        <h1>Tools and Technology</h1>
        <p>To create this app, there are quite a few tools and technologies needed.</p>
        <p>They will be (and not limited to):</p>
        <li>GPS (Global Positions System); Receives information from currently visible satellites to display current location. The system accurately calculates and coordinates where you are situated no matter where that is.</li>
        <li>Cell-ID; a generally unique number used to identify each base transceiver station.</li>
        <li>A-GPS (Assisted GPS); The integration of GPS and Cell-ID. Combined, these provide highly accurate data.</li>
        <li>Geofencing; Refers to a GPS system and determines the closeness of a user to a particular location.</li>
        <li>Framework such as Ionic; visually pleasing, easy to use and widely supported.</li>
        <li>Node.js; is used for the back-end, and focuses on mainly real-time events. Ie. chats, instant messages, likes, and comments. Could consider using PHP-based frameworks like Symphony2.</li>
        <li>Databases such as JSON, SQLite, NoSQL etc.</li>
        <li>Third-party admin panel.</li>
        <li>Cloud Server Service; for example, AWS. Used for processing workloads and storing information. Can access virtual server functions remotely through an online interface.</li>
        <li>A programming language such as Swift; Used for iOS devices & successor to Objective-C (could be used for compatibility with Android as well).</li>
      </article>

      <h1>Skills Required</h1>
      <p>In order to make this project work, I will need to spend the majority of my time learning and developing my skills in the Swift programming language. As well as Swift, I will have to learn more about GPS systems, cloud-based servers, front-end and back-end development and finally frameworks such as PHP or Ionic. For a single person, developing this is definitely feasible, but the addition of a team will be paramount to great success.</p>

      <h1>Outcome</h1>
      <p>I believe if this project is successful, motorcycle riders will enjoy the ability to be able to do all their needed searching, researching and socialising all in one application; without needing to search Google or other third-party websites.</p>
      <p> In addition, for the riders who enjoy getting to the track, the ability to record lap times and store them all in the same app will prove incredibly efficient. Issues and problems within the project will be resolved through testing and feedback from motorcycle riders as this app is tailored specifically for them.</p>
